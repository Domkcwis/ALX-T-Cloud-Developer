# ALX-T-Cloud-Developer
## Project 1 Submission

The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS.

* First, I created an S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies.

* Next, I uploaded the website files to my bucket and speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.

* Lastly, I accessed my website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.
